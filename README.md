# Creating ProteinsAreCool.com from scratch

I decided to create a blog to document thoughts from literature related to Machine Learning for Protein Engineering, collaborate with other protein engineers, and learn new programming languages. As an additional challenge, I decided to use a Windows machine rather than my typical Mac.

## Objectives
1. Save and organize my thoughts from literature.
2. Collaborate with other protein engineers.
3. Learn and apply new programming languages like Markdown, html, CSS, and Javascript.
4. Learn to use a Windows environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install VSCode
1. Open the **Start Menu** and search for "Command Prompt."
2. Right-click on **Command Prompt** and select "Pin to taskbar" for easy future access at the bottom of your desktop screen.
3. Open **Command Prompt** from the taskbar.
4. Type the following command to install Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
   ```
6. Press enter to install
*There are many text editors out there that would also work. I like Sublime the best, but I also have only used Sublime before...

### Step 2: Install Git on Windows machine
1. Type the following command to install Git:
   ```bash
   winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
   ```

### Step 3: Create repository on Github to maintain website
1. Navigate to your Github profile
2. Click on "repositories"
3. Click on New to create a repository.
4. Give the repository a name, description, and include a README file. The other settings depend on various things I am not an expert in so I would google about what license is best for what you want to do. I chose an MIT license (https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-mit-license/)

### Step 4: Setup files for maintaining website on your local machine
1. Open **Command Prompt** from the taskbar
2. Navigate to your desktop to make it easy to see your files
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```
